# Project Purpose\n\nThe AI Analysis Engine is a system designed to automatically analyze evaluation results of algorithms (specifically drowsy detection) and generate detailed analysis reports. It consists of three main components: Orchestrator for overall control and final report generation, PerformanceAnalyzer for overall performance checking and differential analysis, and InstanceAnalyzer for detailed analysis of individual data instances. The system integrates with DataWareHouse for data retrieval and storage, generates visualizations, and uses AI for enhanced analysis.
